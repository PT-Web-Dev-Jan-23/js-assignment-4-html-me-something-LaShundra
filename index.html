            <h3>About J & D Productions</h3>
            <p>J & D Productions began as a hobby. Just doing small crafts for myself, my son and family.
               My youngest son "DeShun" actually asked about making t-shirts while going through a tramatic event. 
               He wanted to become an entreprenuer. So, to please him I ordered all the equipment he needed
               to get started. 
            </p>
            <p> On September 6, 2019 at 12:30am, my doorbell started ringing, there was knocking at the front door. 
               By the time I got to the door, no one was there. I saw flashing lights of a tow truck. Then, there was 
               knocking at my backdoor. I went to the backdoor and there stood a young man that I did not know. 
               My baby boy stood next to me as this young man introduced hisself to me, and said that he came with 
               some bad news. News that he wished he never had to deliver. He was a friend of my oldest son "Jaimon".
               The words that came next is what shattered my family. "Jaimon has been killed in accident".</p>
               
            <p>Jaimon, known to his friends as "JCole", was riding his motorcycle on the riverfront when someone
               pulled out in front of him cutting him off. He was going pretty fast and couldn't avoid hitting the vehicle.
               He died on impact. This is the information that this young man was giving me. My heart started skipping, and I collasped 
               to the floor. He said you need to get to the riverfront down by the graffiti wall. And so I gather myself, start frantically
               calling Jaimon's phone, and jumping in my car racing to get down town. This is a 20 min drive. It seemed like it took me 
               forever to get there, driving with hazard lights flashing, all while calling my son's phone, calling my mother, and my brother
               to let them know the news I just received. 
            </p>

            <p>At 4am, the police finally escorted me to the body to identify my son that died on impact shortly after 12am
               on September, 6, 2019. I would have never thought that I would have to bury my child at the age of 23.
               He had only had that motorcycle for 3 months. My heart was shattered into billions of pieces.

            <h3>Why J & D Productions was started:</h3>
            <section>
               <p>A couple months later, baby boy asked about making and selling sweatshirts. He said that is what he
                  wanted to do. SO, I orderd all the equipment. We didn't set up right away once everything arrived.
                  I think it still took about a month or two before we actually opened the boxes. This was our grieving
                  process. This was to help us cope with the loss that we has just suffered. Basketball season was in full
                  swing for my baby boy. District playoffs was won on his shoulders with the weight of the loss of his brother. 
                  Every shot made by him, was a gift to his brother watching from the heavens. 
               </p>

               <p>Shortly after, COVID hit. So, being shut in and losing my job a few months later, I began crafting and making masks.
                  First mask made was with my son's name. And things took off from there.
